# GPT
This is a repository that shows how a GPT can be trained and fine-tuned from scratch. At the end of all of this training and fine-tuning. The GPT model can be a chatbot with personality and can generate responses more of that a human person would rather than what ChatGPT generates(where its messages state that it is an AI). 

Note: This repository is a work in progress, but I uploaded some basic files to show the initial pretraining step.
